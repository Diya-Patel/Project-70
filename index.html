Vaccination is the leading public health prevention strategy to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Promoting vaccination can help schools safely return to in-person learning as well as extracurricular activities and sports.
Due to the circulating and highly contagious Delta variant, CDC recommends universal indoor masking by all students (age 2 and older), staff, teachers, and visitors to K-12 schools, regardless of vaccination status.
In addition to universal indoor masking, CDC recommends schools maintain at least 3 feet of physical distance between students within classrooms to reduce transmission risk. When it is not possible to maintain a physical distance of at least 3 feet, such as when schools cannot fully re-open while maintaining these distances, it is especially important to layer multiple other prevention strategies, such as screening testing.
Screening testing, ventilation, handwashing and respiratory etiquette, staying home when sick and getting tested, contact tracing in combination with quarantine and isolation, and cleaning and disinfection are also important layers of prevention to keep schools safe.
Students, teachers, and staff should stay home when they have signs of any infectious illness and be referred to their healthcare provider for testing and care.
Many schools serve children under the age of 12 who are not eligible for vaccination at this time. Therefore, this guidance emphasizes implementing layered prevention strategies (e.g., using multiple prevention strategies together consistently) to protect students, teachers, staff, visitors, and other members of their households and support in-person learning.
Localities should monitor community transmission, vaccination coverage, screening testing, and occurrence of outbreaks to guide decisions on the level of layered prevention strategies (e.g., physical distancing, screening testing).

            <p class="col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12 list-group-item-text">I've been using Google Classroom a lot recently since they get quarantined to be online So the teachers can talk to them online and do their work online so when kids need to ask a question they can ask it in the Google chat in Google classroom. One more reason is that teachers  post work on the Google Classroom so kids can do it online  and solve the work online either on kami or just on the classroom itself or they can write their work on Google Documents.Right you see the add all you need to do is go to you own your App Store and search up Google classroom and how to do is press download to join the classroom all your surprise is a plus sign or the teacher will add you to their Google classroom and all I have to do is press join or they will automatically add you. There's so many cool tools and items on Google Classroom. One of them is to privately chat with the teacher so you don't have to feel that other people have to see what you're telling the teacher on the chat. You can also post your work I'm going to go cash and just by uploading it or take the picture of it and Creating a upload of it by just browsing your files and you'll find see that if it's either on your camera roll or on your uploads.You could also see the people that are in your class which is cool since you know who is in your class and what you're going to expect from them. Now the other part is the stream where you see all of the work that is posted in chronological order by the date.</p>
